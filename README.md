# st558-project2

## Purpose

This R Shiny app is designed to facilitate easy and flexible analysis of the [Mobile Device Usage](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/valakhorasani/mobile-device-usage-and-user-behavior-dataset) data from Kaggle.

## Build

First, I prepare a static R project to make a prototype for the dynamic, reactive app. Then, I've transferred over the static elements into R Shiny and created a fitting UI to allow for subsetting and dynamic controls.
